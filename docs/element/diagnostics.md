# Diagnostics and DOM events

Listen for `readinesschange`, `requestedstatechange`, `visualstatechange`,
`transitionstart`, `transitionend`, `underflow`, `fallback`, and `error`.
Events are noncancelable and contain an immutable positive source generation.
All events except `error` bubble and are composed. Register `error` directly on
the element so a motion load failure cannot become a page-wide error. Properties
are staged before dispatch.

```js
motion.addEventListener("error", ({ detail }) => {
  showMessage(detail.failure.code, detail.fatal);
});
const snapshot = motion.getDiagnostics({ trace: true });
```

Diagnostics are bounded observations and do not fetch, retry, prepare, reclaim,
or advance the graph. Traces cap at 512 records. Snapshots omit URLs, paths,
headers, ETags, integrity values, response text, fallback HTML, raw errors,
raw byte payloads, frames, workers, decoders, GL objects, and resource
capabilities. Numeric verified/resident byte counts remain available for
resource diagnosis.

A static prepare result is usable success. Inspect `staticReason` to distinguish
reduced motion, unsupported animation, resource pressure, and failed readiness.
Expected supersession/disconnect/disposal aborts are quiet.

`cleanup` is either `null` or the immutable receipt for the most recently
retired source and identifies both element and source generations. A receipt is
complete only when player disposal, participant unregistration, logical bytes,
leases, registered cleanup, tracked work, pending waits, decoder tickets,
workers, frames, runtime operations, source copies, staging bytes, loads,
transport bodies, interested waiters, renderer/context resources, and cleanup
failures all settle. `failureCount > 0` or any nonzero participant owner keeps
`completed` false and prevents a successor or terminal `finalDisposed` claim.
Page byte, participant, and decoder totals are contextual: they may remain
nonzero because other elements share the page runtime and are not part of this
element's zero-owner proof.
