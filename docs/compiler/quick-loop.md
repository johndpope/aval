# Compile a seamless partial loop

```sh
rma compile input.mov --loop 48:96 --out orbit.rma
```

Frames are canonical. The optional intro is `[0,48)` and the repeating body is
`[48,96)`; no runtime seek is involved. The compiler validates the visual seam,
AVC/random-access profile, strict static, alpha policy, dimensions, and resource
bounds before atomic publication. Unused tail frames produce a warning.

Successful text and JSON output include frame rate, frame/time ranges, visible
and coded geometry, alpha choice, byte/resource estimates, continuity/static/
alpha summary, SHA-256 digest, and copyable element markup. Printed time is an
explanation of frame indices, not a new timestamp authority.
